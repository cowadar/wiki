# Rufus

## Wat is Rufus?

![[rufus screenshot]](../_assets/images/rufus.png)

Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives, such as USB keys/pendrives, memory sticks, etc.

It can be especially useful for cases where:

- you need to create USB installation media from bootable ISOs (Windows, Linux, UEFI, etc.)
- you need to work on a system that doesn't have an OS installed
- you need to flash a BIOS or other firmware from DOS
- you want to run a low-level utility

Despite its small size, Rufus provides everything you need!

Oh, and Rufus is **fast**. For instance it's about twice as fast as [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/), [Universal USB Installer](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3) or [Windows 7 USB download tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool), on the creation of a Windows 7 USB installation drive from an ISO. It is also marginally faster on the creation of Linux bootable USB from ISOs.
A non exhaustive list of Rufus supported ISOs is also provided at the bottom of this page.
